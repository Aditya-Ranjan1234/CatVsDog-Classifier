# Cat and Dog Image Classifier

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images as either cats or dogs.

## Overview

The model is trained on a dataset of 5000 cat and dog images and achieves a reasonable level of accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes. The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Ranjan1234/CatVsDog_Classifier.git

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Sigmoid activation in the output layer for binary classification

## Dataset
